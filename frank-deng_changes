Changes I have made:
-Added sound effect when the viewport is inside cabin.
-Fixed the sound effect for Cabin View.
-Vertical speed for Flight Level Change mode changed to 1000ft/min and -1000ft/min
-Automatically redistribute fuel, instead of setting a fixed fuel amount on startup. And the fuel amount is specified by prop /sim/fuel-fraction.
